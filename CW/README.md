Staying physically active and maintaining sufficient exercise is a challenge in the current COVID situation. 
Design and implement a web-based activity planner application to help students keep track of their weekly exercise goals as well as their achievements.  
The application allows the user to define their own training schedule for each week. Users of the application can also record their actual achievements. These training goals and achievements are private, i.e. they are only visible to this logged in user.
The properties of a weekly training plan can be designed by you but should at least consist of:
•	The dates of the week.
•	A breakdown of the exercise goals for this week. There should be at least three fitness goals for each week, but more can be added.
•	The actual achievements against the goals.
The activity planner application should provide the following core functionality:
•	Training goals can be added.
•	Training goals can be removed.
•	Training goals can be modified.
•	Training goals can be defined for several weeks ahead.
•	Actual training achievements can be recorded at the time they occur, e.g. training goals can be ticked off or actual times or number of repetitions can be recorded.
•	Users are able to see a listing of all incomplete training goals together with the week for which they were planned.
•	Users should be able to share a weekly plan with other users by sending a link to a week’s training schedule. You can assume that anyone who has the link has permission to see that week’s goals and/or achievements
